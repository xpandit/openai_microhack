The pyramid served as a tomb and was built using millions of limestone blocks, with some weighing as much as 15 tons.

Contrary to popular belief, the pyramid was not built by slaves but rather by a large workforce of skilled laborers, including stone masons, engineers, and workers, who were likely conscripted for labor as a form of tax payment and were well-fed and housed. Recent discoveries suggest that thousands of laborers worked in shifts to construct the pyramid over a period of approximately 20 years.\n",
